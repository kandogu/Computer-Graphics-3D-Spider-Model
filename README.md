This assignment includes the following Folder and Files:

Executable:
	insect.html
Source:
	insect.js
	insect.css
	handmovement.txt
	example.PNG
	Common

The first four files were written by us, and the Common files were taken from shared codes as course content.

In order to run the project, the file structure must not be changed. Since the project was coded using the Google Chrome Browser environment, the person who will use it should 
also use this environment in order to prevent errors in the operation of the project. 

You can run the project by using the file named "insect.html" by opening it on Google Chrome Browser.

We used Bootstrap as front-end framework. It will be loaded automatically with Internet connection. The example view of the project is given in "example.PNG" file. If the project 
layout is different from this view, user should be careful about the Internet connection.
